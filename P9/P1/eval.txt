Bubble sort and Insertion sort proved to be a lot faster in sorting arrays of smaller size, but start to take longer as the size of the array increases
Selection sort would be a better algorithm to sort larger arrays than Bubble sort and Insertion sort.
Insertion sort also would be a better algorithm to sort larger arrays along with Selection sort.

During the testing of all three sorting algorithms, with small arrays, from 10-100, bubble sort would prove to be a faster sorting algorithm due to its O(n) time complexity.
However, once the array starts to increase in size, Bubble sort would start to underperform in comparison to other sorting algorithms such as Insertion sort and Selection sort.
The other two algorithms proved to be more efficient in sorting the array a lot faster than Bubble sort due to the O(n^2) time complexity.

updated evaluation

The faster algorithm that sorted a small array was bubbleSort due to the best case being O(N) and average case of O(N^2) even if the array was in reverse as the time complexity between average case and wort case does not change.
However, as the array was significantly larger (700) bubbleSort took the longest time. Showing that InsertionSort was the better algorithm for sorting the larger array due to its time complexity of O(N) / O(N^2), despite it being the same time complexity as bubbleSort, the amount of passes it makes is a lot less than bubbleSort, making it marginally faster.
The worst perfoming algorithm was selectionSort as it produced the slowest time except for test 3, as it is the fastest out of the two as all best, average and worst case scenario time complexity is O(N^2)
In conclusion, smaller arrays would benefit using bubbleSort, larger arrays with InsertionSort and descending arrays with selectionSort.

Quick sorting should be the fastest for the smaller data sets. However, as the data size increases, 
the quick sort will reduce in efficiency and the merge sort will remain consistent with its efficiency.
Merge is always O(N log N) and quick can be optimal (O(N log N)), worst case (O(N^2)) or average (O(N log N)).  
Overall, merge is the preferred sorting method.

Left most pivot selection quick sort is the fastest when n is 100. Quick sort with pivot median of 3 is 
slower than quick sort with left most pivot when n is 1000, 500 and 100. This could be due to how I 
implemented my algorithm for finding the median. Each quick sorting algorithm are faster with smaller 
data sets. However, when the number of elements in the data sets increases, each quick sort reduces in 
efficiency. In contrast, merge sort remains consistent with its efficiency. Thus, quick sorts is (O(N^2)) 
worst case, (O(N log N)) average case, and most optimal with (O(N log N)). While merge sort is always 
O(N log N).
